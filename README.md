# MHRiseImprovedInputs 

Fixed version of [https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterrise/mods/2875](https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterrise/mods/2875)


### Explanation

This shouldn't be necessary for the majority, but it fixes an issue I personally experienced.

In certain scenarios the game will crash when loading in with the original script enabled. This is because it cannot successfully retrieve the appropriate typedefs and call the necessary functions.
